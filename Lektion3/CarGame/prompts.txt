I want to make a car game. First i need Python code that can visually show a threelane where a car
is driving on. It should be possible to control the with arrow keys and wasd. inside th code there
should be easy access to parameters that indicate where the car currently is on the road, as well
as a parameter that tell where the sides of the road is. So that the driver can get indication if
he is no longer on the road.
